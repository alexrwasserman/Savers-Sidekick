# Savers Sidekick

Savers Sidekick is a simple and intuitive budgeting application for iOS devices. Its user-friendly interface makes it the perfect tool for tracking expenses and maintaining a budget on the go. It is intended for users who prefer an easy and portable method of entering expenses at the moment they are incurred, as opposed to setting aside time to update a budget on their computer. This lightweight application takes the complexity out of monitoring your costs.

## Features
* Create, delete, or edit a customized budget that is divided into categories
* Create, delete, or edit expenses within any category
* View a detailed summary of your expenses for any budget
* Export any budget as a CSV file in an email attachment

The goal is to get this published on the App Store. It is less of an entrepreneurial effort and more of a fun side project that I think is cool and have enjoyed working on. I am open to comments/criticism or suggestions for new features. I hope others will find this useful!
